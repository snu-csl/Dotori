ForestDB-Benchmark
==================
ForestDB-Benchmark is a benchmark program for embedded key-value storage engines, based on a sophisticated workload generation which is more realistic than performing a bunch of read/write operations. It generates key-value store operations using the APIs of Couchstore, which is the current storage engine of Couchbase Server. We currently provide API-wrappers for ForestDB, LevelDB, RocksDB, and WiredTiger.
